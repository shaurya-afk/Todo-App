# ToDo App
 Yeah, just a basic project manager, you create a new project and add the task you need to do.

 ## Why am I making this?
 Well, for my own learning purpose. 😁

 ## Basic of what it does.
 1. You create a new project, if you haven't already.
 2. You add the tasks you need to do inorder for you to complete your project.
 3. You can edit the project's name (WOW SO COOL, yeah I know nothing special, but it is what it is... 😐)
 4. Also you can delete the project, in case you give up.... 🫢

_currently it's in development, so not much fancy you'll see here...🫠_
